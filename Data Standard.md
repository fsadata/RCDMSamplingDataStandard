## Supported File Types

Currently we are supporting the standard for comma separated values (CSV) and JSON.

The [current standard for CSV](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) gives a detailed explanation of the common format for CSV files. It's concise and clear and we recommend reading it.

## Other Requirements

### Text Fields

Most of the fields in the standard are text, which needs to be treated carefully when stored in a CSV file. All text fields must be enclosed within double quotes `"this is the text"`. You should try to avoid using double quotes within a text field as this can cause the field to be misread, but the RFC4180 standard allows it if handled appropriately.

>If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with another double quote. For example: `"aaa","b""bb","ccc"`

### Encoding

Where possible please use `UTF-8` encoding.

## File Naming Conventions

To make it easy for us to manage the files longer term, it will be important to name files so that we can tell the period that each file covers. The format will be the date and time of submission in `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` format.

For example, the file submitted the 31st of January 2017 15:20:33 would be named `20170131-152033.csv`.

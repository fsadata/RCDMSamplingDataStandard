## Field Definitions

### 1. Sample ID
**Field Name:** `sample_id`  
**Data Type:** Text (32 character limit)  
**Optional:** No  
**Source:** Lab 
**Comments:** The sample number, as recorded by the laboratory carrying out the tests. This must be a unique value within the records of that lab. It can be any combination of numeric or alphanumeric characters but it must be unique within the laboratory system. 

 ### 2. Producer ID
**Field Name:** `producer_id`  
**Data Type:** Text (32 character limit)  
**Optional:** No  
**Source:** Lab 
**Comments:** The unique Producer reference number supplied to the laboratory by the FSA when a new producer is registered for the production of raw cows drinking milk. The reference will be quoted in the documentation accompanying the sample when the laboratory receives it.

### 3. Test Type
**Field Name:** `test_type`  
**Data Type:** Text (controlled vocabulary)    
**Optional:** No  
**Source:** Lab 
**Comments:** The acceptable values for all tests will be provided by the FSA as a controlled vocabulary in a publicly available register. 
### 4. Test Result
**Field Name:** `test_result`  
**Data Type:** Text (controlled vocabulary)    
**Optional:** No  
**Source:** Lab 
**Comments:** The numeric figure giving the result of the test undertaken.

### 5. Sample Pass
**Field Name:** `sample_pass`  
**Data Type:** Text (controlled vocabulary)    
**Optional:** No  
**Source:** Lab 
**Comments:** `True` or `False`, determined by whether or not the sample passed the respective test.

### 6. Sample Stage
**Field Name:** `sample_stage`  
**Data Type:** Text (controlled vocabulary)    
**Optional:** No

## Supported File Types

Currently we are supporting the standard for comma separated values (CSV) and JSON.

The [current standard for CSV](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) gives a detailed explanation of the common format for CSV files. It's concise and clear and we recommend reading it.

## Other Requirements

### Text Fields

Most of the fields in the standard are text, which needs to be treated carefully when stored in a CSV file. All text fields must be enclosed within double quotes `"this is the text"`. You should try to avoid using double quotes within a text field as this can cause the field to be misread, but the RFC4180 standard allows it if handled appropriately.

>If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with another double quote. For example: `"aaa","b""bb","ccc"`

### Encoding

Where possible please use `UTF-8` encoding.

## File Naming Conventions

To make it easy for us to manage the files longer term, it will be important to name files so that we can tell the period that each file covers. The format will be the date and time of submission in `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` format.

For example, the file submitted the 31st of January 2017 15:20:33 would be named `20170131-152033.csv`.

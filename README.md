# Red Tractor Data Standard

This repository contains the documentation describing the data standard which should be used for membership data being sent from Red Tractor to the Food Standards Agency to allow visit the appropriate visit frequencies to be applied to milk production establishments.

It currently only describes the data standards, rather than the mechanism for submitting data to the Food Standards Agency.
